The second website featured was inspired by an actual auto auction website that used Wix to design and deploy it. I thought it 
would be a good challenge to try and emulate the site as best as I could and even make some changes of my own to make the 
funcitonality and design better. The I mainly emulated the original website layout and I changed everything else by making my 
own logo, color scheme, and adding mobile functionality and responsiveness that the original lacked. This website, with a couple 
of small changes, can be fully funcitonal and be deployed for any real company but I will not be working on it's backend or additional
functionality(google maps api) as it was made mostly for fun and as a challenge to myself. This project is considered done and shelved.
